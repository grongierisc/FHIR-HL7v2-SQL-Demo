Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. \n\nWhen both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference\n\nApplications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.\n\nReference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).

Timing schedules are used for specifying when events are expected or requested to occur, and may also be used to represent the summary of a past or ongoing event.  For simplicity, the definitions of Timing components are expressed as 'future' events, but such components can also be used to describe historic or ongoing events.\n\nA Timing schedule can be a list of events and/or criteria for when the event happens, which can be expressed in a structured form and/or as a code. When both event and a repeating specification are provided, the list of events should be understood as an interpretation of the information in the repeat structure.","requirements":"Allows prompting for activities and detection of missed planned activities.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"CarePlan.activity.detail.scheduled[x]","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Timing"},{"code":"Period"},{"code":"string"}],"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"v2","map":"N/A"},{"identity":"rim","map":"QSET<TS> (GTS)"},{"identity":"workflow","map":"Request.occurrence[x]"},{"identity":"v2","map":"TQ1"},{"identity":"rim","map":".effectiveTime"}]},{"id":"CarePlan.activity.detail.location","path":"CarePlan.activity.detail.location","short":"Where it should happen","definition":"Identifies the facility where the activity will occur; e.g. home, hospital, specific clinic, etc.","comment":"May reference a specific clinical location or may identify a type of location.","requirements":"Helps in planning of activity.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"CarePlan.activity.detail.location","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":["https://fhir.nhs.uk/R4/StructureDefinition/UKCore-Location"]}],"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"},{"key":"ref-1","severity":"error","human":"SHALL have a contained resource if a local reference is provided","expression":"reference.startsWith('#').not() or (reference.substring(1).trace('url') in %rootResource.contained.id.trace('ids'))","xpath":"not(starts-with(f:reference/@value, '#')) or exists(ancestor::*[self::f:entry or self::f:parameter]/f:resource/f:*/f:contained/f:*[f:id/@value=substring-after(current()/f:reference/@value, '#')]|/*/f:contained/f:*[f:id/@value=substring-after(current()/f:reference/@value, '#')])","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CarePlan"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"rim","map":"The target of a resource reference is a RIM entry point (Act, Role, or Entity)"},{"identity":"v2","map":"OBR-24(???!!)"},{"identity":"rim","map":".participation[typeCode=LOC].role"}]},{"id":"CarePlan.activity.detail.location.id","path":"CarePlan.activity.detail.location.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"Unique id for inter-element referencing","definition":"Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
