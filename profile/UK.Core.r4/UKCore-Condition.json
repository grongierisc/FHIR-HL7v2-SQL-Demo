The condition could be a point in time diagnosis in the context of an encounter, it could be an item on the practitioner’s problem list, or it could be a concern that doesn’t exist on the practitioner’s problem list. Often, a condition is about a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of an individual's state of health. It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that a practitioner considers harmful, potentially harmful and may be investigated and managed (problem), or other health issue/situation that may require ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern).","copyright":"Copyright © 2020 HL7 UK Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
